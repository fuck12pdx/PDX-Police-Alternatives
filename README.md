Easy to access information about what to do instead of calling the police.

### How to create a site like this for your city
Create a GitHub account and click "Use this template" to create a new repository with the same files and directory as this one. You can then use a [code editor](https://www.atom.io) to change the HTML and fill in resources for your city, a new [domain name (less than $10/year)](https://www.porkbun.com), and your [secure email](https://www.protonmail.com) for corrections. Use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to push those changes to your new repository. Once you're satisfied, enable [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to make your site live (for free).

**If you do use this template for your city, please navigate to the "Issues" tab on this repository and create an Issue post with your city, and the link to your site once you are finished. This is the closest GitHub has to a comments section for repositories. Hopefully this will ensure that multiple people aren't creating sites for the same city at the same time, and that there isn't confusion over which site to use.**
