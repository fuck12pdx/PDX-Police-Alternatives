### How to create a site like this for your city
Click "Use this template" to create a new repository with the same files and directory as this one. You can then use a [code editor](https://www.atom.io) to change the HTML and fill in resources for your city, a new [domain name (less than $10/year)](https://www.porkbun.com), and your [secure email](https://www.protonmail.com) for corrections. Use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to push those changes to your new repository. Once you're satisfied, enable [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to make your site live (for free).
